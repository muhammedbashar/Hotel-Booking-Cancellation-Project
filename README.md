# Hotel Booking Data Analysis (EDA)
### Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to understand booking patterns, cancellation behaviour, pricing trends, and customer booking channels. The goal is to identify key factors that influence reservation cancellations and provide insights that can support better pricing and revenue management decisions.


### Key Insights

* 37.13% of reservations are cancelled, indicating a significant revenue impact.

* City Hotels have a higher cancellation rate (~42%) compared to Resort Hotels (~28%).

* A higher Average Daily Rate (ADR) is strongly associated with higher cancellation levels.

* August has the highest number of bookings and cancellations, while January shows the highest relative cancellations.

* Online Travel Agencies account for ~47% of bookings and a similar share of cancellations.

* Direct bookings have the lowest cancellation rate.

### Tools & Technologies

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Jupyter Notebook

### Outcome

This project demonstrates how pricing, seasonality, hotel type, and booking channels influence hotel cancellations. The insights can be used to improve pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and optimise revenue performance.
